# Gesture-Sense
1.This project implements a hand gesture recognition system capable of identifying various hand signs using computer vision techniques. The model is designed to detect and interpret specific gestures, making it useful for applications such as human-computer interaction, sign language translation, and touchless control systems.
2.Developed a real time hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV, Mediapipe and scikit-learn.
3. Extracted hand landmarks from video feed and classified gestures using a K-Nearest NEighbors(KNN) model.
4. Implemented recognition for 5 predefined gestures with the flexibility to add more gestures dynamically without
modifying the core model.
